Event-Driven Systems pass and persist events. They have evolved from the publisher-subscriber model, and the design has some advantages. Events are immutable and can be replayed to allow the systems to take snapshots of their behavior. This allows services to 'self-heal'.

A lot of transaction issues are alleviated once idempotency and retrial logic is added to a system. The system can retry messages an infinite number of times to the recipient till there is a message acceptance and acknowledgment from the receiver.

Event-driven systems are closely related to event sources and CQRS. Greg Young and Martin Fowler have been talking about these systems for a while. Events are persisted in something like a message queue, and hence the responsibility to retrial and persistence is moved to it.

These abstractions enable the programmer to focus on the business logic of a system and add subscribers to events with minimum coupling with other services. Decoupling the system is one of the advantages of event-driven systems.

One major disadvantage of this system is that it is difficult to reason about the flow of a request. Services can independently register for an event and consume it without the publisher being aware of it.
