Horizontal scaling is adding more machines to deal with increasing requirements. These machines handle requests in parallel to improve user experience.

Vertical scaling is replacing the current machines with more advanced machines to improve throughput and hence response time. The techniques are used in conjunction in real world systems.

Ideally, a combination of both is used in real life.


| Horizontal Scaling | Vertical Scaling |
| ---- | ---- |
| -> Requires a load balancer. | ->NA |
| -> Resilient | -> Single point of failure |
| -> Network calls in form of Remote procedure calls | -> Inter process communication           |
| -> Data inconsistency, e.g. transactions<br>in dbms.<br> | -> Consistent |
| -> Scales well | -> Hardware limit |


Remote Procedure Call is a technique for building distributed systems. Basically, it allows a program on one machine to call a subroutine on another machine without knowing that it is remote. RPC is not a transport protocol: rather, it is a method of using existing communications features in a transparent way. This transparency is one of the great strengths of RPC as a tool. Because the application software does not contain any communication code, it is independent of

- The particular communications hardware and protocols used
- The operating system used
- The calling sequence needed to use the underlying communications software.

### **Horizontal Scaling a Monolith: Example** ###

**Scenario**: Imagine a traditional e-commerce application built as a monolith, where all functionalities (product catalog, order processing, payment, user management) are part of a single, unified code base and share the same database.

**Challenges**

1. **State Management**: Suppose the application uses session-based authentication. If a user logs in on one instance and the next request is routed to a different instance (due to load balancing), the new instance may not recognize the user's session. Solutions like sticky sessions or distributed session management become necessary.
2. **Resource Utilization**: The application might have components (like the product catalog) that are more heavily used than others (like payment processing). When scaling horizontally, each new instance includes all components, even the less frequently used ones, leading to inefficient resource use.
3. **Deployment Complexity**: Deploying a new version of the monolith requires updating all instances simultaneously. This can lead to significant downtime or require complex rolling update strategies.
4. **Load Balancing:** The application needs an effective load balancer to distribute incoming traffic evenly across all instances, ensuring no single instance becomes a bottleneck.

  
### **Horizontal Scaling Micro services: Example** ###

Scenario: Consider the same e-commerce application, but now re-architected into micro services, **with separate services for product catalog, order processing, user management, and payment processing.**

**Challenges**:

1. **Service Discovery**: As you scale out the order processing service to handle high demand, the product catalog service must dynamically discover these new instances to communicate with them for stock checks.
2. **Network Latency**: The user management service might need to communicate with the order processing service. More instances could mean increased network calls, leading to higher latency.
3. **Data Integrity and Transaction Management**: If a customer places an order, this transaction might involve the order service, payment service, and inventory service. Ensuring consistency across these services if one part of the transaction fails (like payment failure) is complex.
4. **Monitoring and Logging**: Each micro service generates its own logs. With more instances, aggregating these logs into a central monitoring tool becomes crucial to diagnose issues.
5. **Dependency Management:** If the payment processing service is scaled up due to high demand, its dependent services, like the order processing service, might also need to scale up, leading to a cascading effect.
