Observer is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object they’re observing.


Learnings:
1. Observer pattern defines one to many dependency between objects. One change in state of an objects notified all the dependent objects automatically.
2.  Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.

Bullet points:
- The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many relationship between objects.
- Subjects, or as we also know them, Observables, update Observers using a common interface.
- Observers are loosely coupled in that the Observable knows nothing about them, other than that they implement the Observer Interface.
- You can push or pull data from the Observable when using the pattern (pull is considered more “correct”).
- Don’t depend on a specific order of notification for your Observers.
- Java has several implementations of the Observer Pattern, including the general purpose java.util.Observable.


```ts
interface Subject {
    attach(observer: Observer): void;
    detach(observer: Observer): void;
    notify(): void;
}

class ConcreteSubject implements Subject {
    public state: number = 0;
    private observers: Observer[] = [];

    public attach(observer: Observer): void {
        this.observers.push(observer);
        console.log("Subject: Attached an observer");
    }

    public detach(observer: Observer): void {
        this.observers=this.observers.filter(obs=>obs!==observer);
        console.log('Subject: Detached an observer.');
    }

    public notify(): void {
        console.log('Subject: Notifying observers...');
        for (const observer of this.observers) {
            observer.update(this);
        }
    }

    public someBusinessLogic(): void {
        console.log('Subject: I am doing something important.');
        this.state = Math.floor(Math.random() * (10 + 1));

        console.log(`Subject: My state has just changed to: ${this.state}`);
        this.notify();
    }
}

interface Observer {
    update(subject: Subject): void;
}

class ConcreteObserverA implements Observer {
    public update(subject: Subject): void {
        if (subject instanceof ConcreteSubject) {
            console.log('ConcreteObserverA: Reacted to the event.');
        }
    }
}

class ConcreteObserverB implements Observer {
    public update(subject: Subject): void {
        if (subject instanceof ConcreteSubject) {
            console.log('ConcreteObserverB: Reacted to the event.');
        }
    }
}

/**

const subject = new ConcreteSubject();

const observerA = new ConcreteObserverA();
subject.attach(observerA);

const observerB = new ConcreteObserverB();
subject.attach(observerB);

subject.someBusinessLogic();

subject.detach(observerA);

subject.someBusinessLogic();
