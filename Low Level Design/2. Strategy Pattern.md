**Strategy** is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.

Points to be noted:
1. **Take what varies and "encapsulate" it so it would not affect the code.** Results in fewer unintented consequences from code changes and more flexibility in your systems.
2. **Program to an interface not an implementation.** Program to an interface meaning code to an superType. Eg: Animal a=new Dog.
3. **Has-a relation is better than Is-a.** Favor  composition over inheritance.

```ts
interface Strategy {
    method(): string
}

class ConcreteStrategyA implements Strategy {
    method() {
        return 'I am ConcreteStrategyA'
    }
}

class ConcreteStrategyB implements Strategy {
    method() {
        return 'I am ConcreteStrategyB'
    }
}

class ConcreteStrategyC implements Strategy {
    method() {
        return 'I am ConcreteStrategyC'
    }
}

class ObjectContext {
    strategy:Strategy;

    constructor(strategy:Strategy) {
        this.strategy=strategy;
    }

    callMethod() {
        return this.strategy.method();
    }
}

console.log(new ObjectContext(new ConcreteStrategyA).callMethod())
console.log(new ObjectContext(new ConcreteStrategyB).callMethod())
console.log(new ObjectContext(new ConcreteStrategyC).callMethod())
```
