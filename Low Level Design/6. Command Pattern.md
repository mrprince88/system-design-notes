**Command** is behavioral design pattern that converts requests or simple operations into objects.

The Command Pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize other objects with different requests, queue or log requests, and support
undo operations.

**Identification:** The Command pattern is recognizable by behavioral methods in an abstract/interface type (sender) which invokes a method in an implementation of a different abstract/interface type (receiver) which has been encapsulated by the command implementation during its creation. Command classes are usually limited to specific actions.

Bullet points:
- Command Pattern decouples an object, making a request from the one that knows how to perform it.
- Command object is in the center of this decoupling and encapsulates a receiver with an action (or set of actions) .
- An invoker makes a request of a Command object by calling its execute() method, which invokes those actions on the receiver.
- Invokers can be parameterized with Commands, even dynamically at runtime.
- Commands may support undo by implementing an undo method that restores the object to its previous state before the execute() method was last called.
- Macro Commands are a simple extension of Command that allow multiple commands to be invoked. Likewise, Macro Commands can easily support undo().
- In practice, it is not uncommon for “smart” Command objects to implement the request themselves rather than delegating to a receiver.
- Commands may also be used to implement logging and transactional systems.

```ts
interface Command {
    execute(): void;
    undo(): void;
}

class NoCommand implements Command {
    public execute():void {}
    public undo():void {}
}

// Receiver
class Light {
    on() {
        console.log("light on");
    }
    off() {
        console.log("light off");
    }
}

// Sender
class LightOnCommand implements Command {
    light:Light;

    constructor(light:Light) {
        this.light=light;
    }

    public execute() {
        this.light.on();
    }

    public undo() {
        this.light.off();
    }
}

// Sender
class LightOffCommand implements Command {
    light:Light;

    constructor(light:Light) {
        this.light=light;
    }

    public execute() {
        this.light.off();
    }

    public undo() {
        this.light.on();
    }
}

class MacroCommand implements Command {

    commands:Command[]=[];

    constructor(commands:Command[]) {
        this.commands=commands;
    }

    public execute() {
        for(let command of this.commands)
            command.execute();
    }

    public undo() {
        for(let command of this.commands)
            command.undo();
    }
}


const light=new Light();
const LightOnController=new LightOnCommand(light);
const LightOffController=new LightOffCommand(light);
const PartyController=new MacroCommand([
    LightOnController,
    LightOffController,
    LightOnController,
    LightOffController
]);

LightOnController.execute();
LightOffController.execute();
PartyController.execute();
