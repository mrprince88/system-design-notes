## Adapter Pattern

**Adapter** is a structural design pattern that converts the interface of a class into another interface the clients expect. It lets classes work together that couldn’t otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

**Bullet points:**
- When you need to use an existing class and its interface is not the one you need, use an adapter.
- An adapter changes an interface into one a client expects.
- Implementing an adapter may require little work or a great deal of work depending on the size and complexity of the target interface.
- There are two forms of the Adapter Pattern: object and class adapters. Class adapters require multiple inheritance.
- An adapter wraps an object to change its interface, a decorator wraps an object to add new behaviors and responsibilities, and a facade “wraps” a set of objects to simplify.

```ts
interface Target {
    request(): string;
}

/* new implementation we came up for new objects */
class NewAdapter implements Target {
    request() {
        return 'New Apapter: Request successful';
    }
}

/* old implementation */
class Adaptee {interface Target {
    request(): string;
}

/* new implementation we came up for new objects */
class NewAdapter implements Target {
    request() {
        return 'New Apapter: Request successful';
    }
}

/* old implementation */
class Adaptee {
    public specificRequest(): string {
        return 'This is specific request function call';
    }
}

/* old implementation wrapped in an adapter to support target interface */
class Adapter implements Target {
    private adaptee: Adaptee;

    constructor(adaptee: Adaptee) {
        this.adaptee = adaptee;
    }

    public request(): string {
        return `Adapter:${this.adaptee.specificRequest}`;
    }
}

function clientCode(target: Target) {
    console.log(target.request());
}

console.log('Client: I can work just fine with the Target objects:');
const target = new NewAdapter();
clientCode(target);

const adaptee = new Adaptee();
console.log('Client: I can work with Adaptee via the Adapter:');
const adapter = new Adapter(adaptee);
clientCode(adapter);

    public specificRequest(): string {
        return 'This is specific request function call';
    }
}

/* old implementation wrapped in an adapter to support target interface */
class Adapter implements Target {
    private adaptee: Adaptee;

    constructor(adaptee: Adaptee) {
        this.adaptee = adaptee;
    }

    public request(): string {
        return `Adapter:${this.adaptee.specificRequest}`;
    }
}

function clientCode(target: Target) {
    console.log(target.request());
}

console.log('Client: I can work just fine with the Target objects:');
const target = new NewAdapter();
clientCode(target);

const adaptee = new Adaptee();
console.log('Client: I can work with Adaptee via the Adapter:');
const adapter = new Adapter(adaptee);
clientCode(adapter);

```


## Facade Pattern

The Facade Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a uniﬁed interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. It deﬁnes a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

**Principle of least knowledge / Law of demeter**

It states that:
*"Talk to your immediate neighbors"*

This principle prevents us from creating designs that have a large number of classes coupled together so that changes in one part of the system cascade to other parts. When you build a lot of dependencies between many classes, you are building a fragile system that will be costly to maintain and complex for others to understand.

We should only invoke methods that belong to:
- The object itself
- Objects passed in as a parameter to the method
- Any object the method creates or instantiates
- Any components of the object

Not to do:
```ts
getTemp() {
	Thermometer thermometer = station.getThermometer();
	return thermometer.getTemperature();
}
```

instead:

```ts
getTemp() {
	return station.getTemperature(); // station is an object which facilitates this call
}
```


 **Bullet points:**

- When you have to simplify and unify a large interface or complex set of interface use a facade.
- A facade decouples a client from complex subsystem.
- Implementing a facade requires that we compose the facade with its subsystem and use delegation to perform the work of the facade.
- You can implement more than one facade for a subsystem.


```ts
class Facade {
    protected subsystem1: Subsystem1;
    protected subsystem2: Subsystem2;

    constructor(subsystem1?: Subsystem1, subsystem2?: Subsystem2) {
        this.subsystem1 = subsystem1 || new Subsystem1();
        this.subsystem2 = subsystem2 || new Subsystem2();
    }

    // Encapsulates initialisation and execution of operations on object
    public operation(): string {
        let result = 'Facade initializes subsystems:\n';
        result += this.subsystem1.ready();
        result += this.subsystem2.ready();
        result += 'Facade orders subsystems to perform the action:\n';
        result += this.subsystem1.operationN();
        result += this.subsystem2.operationZ();

        return result;
    }
}
class Subsystem1 {
    public ready(): string {
        return 'Subsystem1: Ready!\n';
    }

    // ...

    public operationN(): string {
        return 'Subsystem1: Go!\n';
    }
}

class Subsystem2 {
    public ready(): string {
        return 'Subsystem2: Get ready!\n';
    }

    // ...

    public operationZ(): string {
        return 'Subsystem2: Fire!';
    }
}

function clientCode(facade: Facade) {
    // ...

    console.log(facade.operation());

    // ...
}

const subsystem1 = new Subsystem1();
const subsystem2 = new Subsystem2();
const facade = new Facade(subsystem1, subsystem2);
clientCode(facade);
```
