## Adapter Pattern

**Adapter** is a structural design pattern that converts the interface of a class into another interface the clients expect. It lets classes work together that couldn’t otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

**Bullet points:**
- When you need to use an existing class and its interface is not the one you need, use an adapter.
- An adapter changes an interface into one a client expects.
- Implementing an adapter may require little work or a great deal of work depending on the size and complexity of the target interface.
- An adapter wraps an object to change its interface, a decorator wraps an object to add new behaviors and responsibilities, and a facade “wraps” a set of objects to simplify.

```ts
interface Target {
    request(): string;
}

/* new implementation we came up for new objects */
class NewAdapter implements Target {
    request() {
        return 'New Apapter: Request successful';
    }
}

/* old implementation */
class Adaptee {interface Target {
    request(): string;
}

/* new implementation we came up for new objects */
class NewAdapter implements Target {
    request() {
        return 'New Apapter: Request successful';
    }
}

/* old implementation */
class Adaptee {
    public specificRequest(): string {
        return 'This is specific request function call';
    }
}

/* old implementation wrapped in an adapter to support target interface */
class Adapter implements Target {
    private adaptee: Adaptee;

    constructor(adaptee: Adaptee) {
        this.adaptee = adaptee;
    }

    public request(): string {
        return `Adapter:${this.adaptee.specificRequest}`;
    }
}

function clientCode(target: Target) {
    console.log(target.request());
}

console.log('Client: I can work just fine with the Target objects:');
const target = new NewAdapter();
clientCode(target);

const adaptee = new Adaptee();
console.log('Client: I can work with Adaptee via the Adapter:');
const adapter = new Adapter(adaptee);
clientCode(adapter);

    public specificRequest(): string {
        return 'This is specific request function call';
    }
}

/* old implementation wrapped in an adapter to support target interface */
class Adapter implements Target {
    private adaptee: Adaptee;

    constructor(adaptee: Adaptee) {
        this.adaptee = adaptee;
    }

    public request(): string {
        return `Adapter:${this.adaptee.specificRequest}`;
    }
}

function clientCode(target: Target) {
    console.log(target.request());
}

console.log('Client: I can work just fine with the Target objects:');
const target = new NewAdapter();
clientCode(target);

const adaptee = new Adaptee();
console.log('Client: I can work with Adaptee via the Adapter:');
const adapter = new Adapter(adaptee);
clientCode(adapter);
